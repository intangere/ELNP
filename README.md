# ELNP
A simple english parser that attempts to identify the topics of<br>
sentences, paragraphs, or entire articles.<br>
Along with this, it is capable of generating sentences<br>
based off of given data.<br>
I wrote this a LONG time ago but thought it was worth a upload.<br>
It can generate very spooky poems Ex.<br>
>in how you lie turning to dust, <br>
>about all day As my fear <br>
>the me look yet turn to come now <br>
>that once thou , My parents do closed ? <br> 
>now so one demon <br>
>it gets to Thou <br>
>but keeps me do hiding off Thou . <br> 
>The Wicked Of Path Destiny <br>
>The it do rust quench to burn there <br> 
>he are that chance of lurk, room, tilt <br>
>So how me do turning to Destiny <br>
>weeping to Path <br>
>My lie hiding <br>
>that soul thou , my dreams walk torn ? <br>
>thirst, And now ? <br>
>My parents shall have in, <br>
>that room, smirk , my bones look lie . <br> 
>that bad mans , that old back <br>
>n't off one back <br>
