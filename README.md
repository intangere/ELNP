# ELNP
A simple english parser that attempts to identify the topics of<br>
sentences, paragraphs, or entire articles.<br>
Along with this, it is capable of generating sentences<br>
based off of given data.<br>
I wrote this a LONG time ago but thought it was worth a upload.<br>
It can generate very spooky poems Ex.<br>
>in how you lie turning to dust, 
>about all day As my fear 
>the me look yet turn to come now 
>that once thou , My parents do closed ? 
>now so one demon 
>it gets to Thou 
>but keeps me do hiding off Thou . 
>The Wicked Of Path Destiny 
>The it do rust quench to burn there 
>he are that chance of lurk, room, tilt 
>So how me do turning to Destiny 
>weeping to Path 
>My lie hiding 
>that soul thou , my dreams walk torn ? 
>thirst, And now ? 
>My parents shall have in, 
>that room, smirk , my bones look lie . 
>that bad mans , that old back 
>n't off one back
